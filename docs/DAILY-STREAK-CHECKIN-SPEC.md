## Executive Summary

The Daily Streak Check-In feature transforms FitCircle's daily tracking into an addictive, gamified experience that drives consistent user engagement. Drawing inspiration from Duolingo's industry-leading streak mechanics (9M+ users with 1-year streaks), Snapchat's social streak system, and Apple Fitness's activity ring closures, this feature will be the cornerstone of habit formation in FitCircle.

### Key Design Principles
1. **ONE Daily Streak Check-In** counts toward the streak (prevents gaming the system)
2. **Multiple Updates Per Day** allowed but don't increment streak (mood, energy, weight can be updated throughout the day)
3. **Clear Visual Distinction** between "Today's Check-In" (streak-eligible) vs "Update Stats" (non-streak)
4. **Generous Grace Mechanics** with Streak Freezes to reduce churn
5. **Celebration-First Design** with animations, badges, and milestones
6. **Loss Aversion Psychology** - users should feel emotional investment in maintaining their streak

### Impact Goals
- **+60% increase** in daily active users (DAU) - based on Duolingo's streak impact
- **+21% reduction** in user churn - based on Streak Freeze effectiveness
- **3.6x more likely** to complete 90-day challenges - users with 7+ day streaks
- **85%+ retention** at 30 days for users who reach a 7-day streak

---

## Research Findings

### Duolingo Streak Mechanics (Industry Leader)
- **9 million users** maintain 1-year+ streaks
- **Streak Freeze** feature reduced churn by **21%** for at-risk users
- Users with **7-day streaks** are **3.6x more likely** to complete their goals
- **Double Streak Freeze** (2 equipped at once) increased active learners by **+0.38%**
- **Streak Repair** allows one restoration per month (premium feature)
- **Home Screen Widget** provides constant visual reminder of current streak
- **Friend Streaks** add social accountability layer

### Snapchat Streak System
- Streaks start after **3 consecutive days** of mutual interaction
- **Fire emoji + number** shows days (e.g., 🔥 127)
- **Hourglass emoji ⏳** warns when about to expire (4-hour window)
- **Group Streaks** introduced in 2024 for collective accountability
- **Instant Streaks** (premium feature) skip 3-day requirement
- **One free restore per month** for premium subscribers
- Psychology: **Commitment bias** - users invested in their progress don't want to lose it

### Apple Fitness Activity Rings
- **Retroactive awards** - users get credit for past achievements
- **Streak badges** for consecutive days of ring closures (Move, Exercise, Stand, All)
- **Monthly challenges** require 7 consecutive days in January for New Year's badge
- **Smart notifications** remind users to "check your rings" if behind pace
- Visual design: **Circular progress meters** create satisfying closure experience

### Strava & Fitbit
- **Daily Readiness Score** (Fitbit) combines sleep quality, HRV, and recent activity
- **Habit trackers** with daily reminders and progress reports
- **Trophy Case** showcases all completed challenges (social proof)
- **Streak-based incentives** linked to premium benefits

### Key Takeaways for FitCircle
1. **Streaks are THE killer feature** - Duolingo's billion-dollar business is built on them
2. **Loss aversion > achievement motivation** - fear of losing a 100-day streak is more powerful than earning a badge
3. **Grace mechanics are essential** - Streak Freezes reduce churn by 21%
4. **Social accountability multiplies engagement** - Friend Streaks and Group Streaks
5. **Visual design matters** - Fire emoji, rings, numbers create satisfying progress visualization
6. **Premium monetization opportunity** - Extra freezes, streak repairs, early streak bonuses
7. **Daily Readiness + Check-In** - Adapt challenge intensity to user's state

## Feature Overview & Goals

### What Counts Toward the Engagement Streak?

The **Engagement Streak** tracks consecutive days where the user completes **at least one qualifying activity**:

#### Streak-Eligible Activities (ONE per day counts)
1. **Daily Check-In Completion** - Completes the full check-in flow (mood + energy + optional weight/steps)
2. **Circle Check-In** - Submits a check-in to any active FitCircle
3. **Weight Log** - Logs weight for the day
4. **Steps Log** - Logs or syncs steps (10,000+ steps or daily goal)
5. **Mood/Energy Log** - Logs both mood AND energy

**Rule:** The **first qualifying activity of the day** starts the check-in and counts toward the streak. Subsequent activities update stats but don't re-increment the streak.

#### Non-Streak Activities (Still Valuable!)
- Viewing dashboard
- Browsing circles
- Chatting with friends
- Updating profile
- Reading content

### Multiple Check-Ins Per Day - UX Design

**Challenge:** Users may want to update mood/energy throughout the day, but only ONE check-in should count toward the streak.

**Solution:** Two distinct interaction modes:

#### Mode 1: "Daily Check-In" (Streak-Eligible) ⭐
- **When:** First check-in of the day
- **UI:** Large, prominent card on dashboard
- **CTA:** "Complete Today's Check-In" with flame icon 🔥
- **Flow:** Full onboarding sequence with celebration
- **Badge:** "Streak Check-In Complete" ✅
- **Color:** Orange/Gold gradient (emphasizes importance)
- **Animation:** Confetti + flame animation on completion
- **Locks After:** First completion - button disabled, shows "✅ Check-In Complete"

#### Mode 2: "Update Stats" (Non-Streak) 📊
- **When:** After completing daily check-in
- **UI:** Smaller, secondary button on dashboard
- **CTA:** "Update Mood & Energy" (no flame icon)
- **Flow:** Quick inline form, no celebration animation
- **Badge:** "Stats Updated" (subtle)
- **Color:** Muted blue/gray
- **Animation:** Simple fade transition
- **Always Available:** Can update multiple times per day

**Visual Hierarchy:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔥 COMPLETE TODAY'S CHECK-IN (Day 47)          │  ← Large, orange, prominent
│  Lock in your streak! (Once per day)            │
│  [COMPLETE CHECK-IN] ←─────────────────────────┐│

│  [UPDATE MOOD & ENERGY] ←───────────────────────┤│  ← Smaller, secondary

### Streak Freeze System

Drawing from Duolingo's proven mechanics:

#### How Freezes Work
- **Starting Freezes:** 1 freeze on signup
- **Earn Freezes:** Gain 1 freeze every **7 consecutive days** of maintained streak
- **Maximum Freezes:** 5 freezes (prevents hoarding)
- **Auto-Use:** If you miss a day, a freeze is **automatically consumed** (user doesn't have to remember)
- **Weekly Refresh:** Gain 1 freeze every 7 days (up to max of 5)

#### Freeze Notifications
- **Before Missing:** "Don't forget to check in! You have 2 freezes available if you miss today."
- **When Used:** "Streak Freeze Used! Your 47-day streak is safe. You have 1 freeze remaining."
- **Last Freeze Warning:** "⚠️ This is your last freeze! Check in tomorrow to keep your 52-day streak alive."
- **No Freezes:** "💔 Streak broken! Your 89-day streak has ended. Start a new one today!"

#### Purchase Additional Freezes (Premium Monetization)
- **Cost:** $0.99 per freeze or 100 XP
- **Bundle:** 5 freezes for $3.99 (20% discount)
- **Max Purchase:** Can't exceed 5 total freezes
- **Premium Perk:** FitCircle Pro members get **2 starting freezes** and earn freezes every **5 days** instead of 7

### Streak Repair System

Inspired by Duolingo's "Streak Repair" feature:

#### How Repair Works
- **Window:** Can repair a broken streak within **24 hours** of it breaking
- **Cost:**
  - **Free users:** $2.99 one-time fee
  - **Pro users:** 1 free repair per month, then $2.99
- **Limitations:** Can only repair streaks **7 days or longer**
- **Cooldown:** 30-day cooldown between repairs (prevents abuse)

#### Repair Flow
1. User misses a day → Streak breaks → Notification sent
2. "💔 Your 47-day streak is broken! Repair it within 24 hours?"
3. User taps "Repair Streak" → Payment/XP confirmation
4. Streak restored → Celebration animation
5. Badge earned: "Second Chance" 🔄

## Database Schema Requirements

### Changes to Existing Tables

#### 1. `engagement_streaks` Table (Already Exists)

**No changes needed** - Current schema is perfect:
```sql
CREATE TABLE engagement_streaks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE UNIQUE,

    -- Streak tracking
    current_streak INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    longest_streak INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_engagement_date DATE,

    -- Freeze/grace system
    streak_freezes_available INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    streak_freezes_used_this_week INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    auto_freeze_reset_date DATE,

    -- Pause system (life events)
    paused BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    pause_start_date DATE,
    pause_end_date DATE,

    -- Timestamps
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 2. `engagement_activities` Table (Already Exists)

**Add column for check-in time:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE engagement_activities
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS activity_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW();

-- Add index for timestamp queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_engagement_activities_timestamp
ON engagement_activities(user_id, activity_timestamp DESC);
```

#### 3. `daily_tracking` Table (Already Exists)

**Add columns for check-in state:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE daily_tracking
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_streak_check_in BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS check_in_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS yesterday_feeling TEXT CHECK (
  yesterday_feeling IN ('great', 'ok', 'not_great')
);

-- Add index for streak check-in queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_daily_tracking_streak_check_in
ON daily_tracking(user_id, tracking_date, is_streak_check_in);

-- Add comment
COMMENT ON COLUMN daily_tracking.is_streak_check_in IS
'True if this entry counted toward the daily engagement streak. Only the first check-in of the day sets this to true.';
```

### New Tables

#### 4. `streak_milestones` Table

**Purpose:** Track milestone achievements and rewards

```sql

    days_achieved INTEGER NOT NULL,
    achieved_date DATE NOT NULL,

    -- Rewards
    xp_earned INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    badges_earned TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',  -- Array of badge IDs

    unlocks TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',        -- Array of feature unlocks

    -- Celebration
    celebrated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    celebration_viewed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,

    -- Timestamps
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

    -- Unique constraint: one milestone per type per user
    CONSTRAINT unique_user_milestone UNIQUE (user_id, milestone_type)
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_streak_milestones_user_id ON streak_milestones(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_streak_milestones_achieved_date ON streak_milestones(achieved_date DESC);

-- RLS Policies
ALTER TABLE streak_milestones ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own milestones"

```

#### 7. `streak_freeze_usage` Table

**Purpose:** Track when freezes are used (for analytics and transparency)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS streak_freeze_usage (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

---

## Gamification Mechanics

### Psychological Principles Applied

#### 1. Loss Aversion (Primary Driver)
- **Principle:** People are more motivated to avoid losing something than to gain something new
- **Implementation:**
  - Streak counter prominently displayed (always visible)
  - Emotional language: "Don't break your 47-day streak!"
  - Warning notifications before streak expiration
  - Grace mechanics (freezes) reduce anxiety while maintaining urgency
- **Data:** Duolingo's streak loss accounts for 21% churn reduction with Streak Freeze

#### 2. Commitment Bias
- **Principle:** People continue behaviors they've invested time/effort in
- **Implementation:**
  - Streak counter shows investment (47 days = 47 moments of commitment)
  - Historical calendar view shows pattern of dedication
  - "You've come so far, don't stop now!"
- **Data:** Users with 7+ day streaks are 3.6x more likely to reach 90-day goals

#### 3. Variable Rewards (Milestone System)
- **Principle:** Unpredictable rewards increase engagement (slot machine effect)
- **Implementation:**
  - Milestone celebrations at varying intervals (3, 7, 14, 30, 50, 100, 365 days)
  - Surprise rewards at milestones (badges, XP, freezes, unlocks)
  - "Next milestone" tease keeps users curious
- **Data:** Milestone badges boost completion rates by 30% (fitness app research)

#### 4. Social Proof & Competition
- **Principle:** People want to match or exceed peers
- **Implementation:**
  - Streak leaderboard (friends and global)
  - Friend streak comparisons
  - "X% of users have shorter streaks than you!"
  - Share achievements to social media
- **Data:** Social features drive 40% more engagement (Strava)

#### 5. Progress Visualization
- **Principle:** Seeing progress motivates continued effort
- **Implementation:**
  - Circular progress rings (Apple Fitness inspiration)
  - Animated progress bars
  - Calendar heatmap showing daily check-ins
  - "You're 94% to your next milestone!"
- **Data:** Visual progress tracking reduces churn by 15%

#### 6. Immediate Feedback
- **Principle:** Fast feedback loops increase behavior reinforcement
- **Implementation:**
  - Instant celebration animation on check-in
  - XP gain notification immediately visible
  - Confetti/haptic feedback on completion
- **Data:** Immediate feedback creates dopamine release (neuroscience research)

### Reward Schedule

#### XP Rewards
- **Daily Check-In:** +10 XP (base)
- **3-Day Streak:** +30 XP (bonus)
- **7-Day Streak:** +100 XP (milestone)
- **14-Day Streak:** +200 XP (milestone)
- **30-Day Streak:** +500 XP (milestone)
