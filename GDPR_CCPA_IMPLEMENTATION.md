# GDPR & CCPA Compliance Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

FitCircle now has **full GDPR and CCPA compliance** with a beautiful, design-forward implementation that respects user privacy while maintaining an excellent user experience.

---

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Layer** (`supabase/migrations/016_add_consent_management.sql`)

**Two new tables:**

#### `user_consent` - Audit Trail
- Stores every consent decision with full metadata
- Required by GDPR to prove valid consent
- Includes: consent type, timestamp, IP address, user agent, GPC signal
- **Retention:** 5 years (compliance requirement)
- Immutable records (no updates/deletes - withdrawal marked by `withdrawn_at`)

#### `privacy_settings` - Current Preferences
- Stores user's current privacy choices
- Controls: analytics, marketing, CCPA opt-out
- Updated when user changes preferences
- Used to enforce consent at runtime

### 2. **Cookie Consent Banner** (`app/components/CookieConsentBanner.tsx`)

**Features:**
- ✅ Shows on first visit only
- ✅ Clean, modern UI matching FitCircle brand (purple/indigo gradients)
- ✅ Three buttons: Accept All / Reject All / Customize
- ✅ Expandable details panel with granular controls
- ✅ Honors Global Privacy Control (GPC) browser signal automatically
- ✅ Stores consent in cookie AND database for audit trail
- ✅ Animated with Framer Motion (smooth slide-up)

**Cookie Categories:**
- **Essential** (always on): Supabase auth, session management
- **Analytics** (toggle): Amplitude tracking, session replay
- **Marketing** (toggle, disabled): Future use

### 3. **Conditional Amplitude Loading** (`app/lib/amplitude.ts`)

**Changes:**
- ❌ **Removed** auto-initialization (was violating GDPR!)
- ✅ Checks consent cookie before initializing
- ✅ Provides `initializeAmplitude()` function for post-consent loading
- ✅ Proxy wrapper that blocks tracking methods if no consent
- ✅ Console warnings when tracking attempted without consent

**Before:**
```typescript
// ❌ GDPR VIOLATION
amplitude.init(...);  // Loads immediately
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ GDPR COMPLIANT
if (checkConsent()) {
  amplitude.init(...);  // Only loads with consent
}
```

### 4. **Privacy Settings Page** (`app/settings/privacy/page.tsx`)

**User Rights Implementation:**
- 📥 **Download Data** - GDPR Article 15 (Right to Access)
- 🗑️ **Delete Account** - GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure)
- 🍪 **Manage Cookies** - Change consent preferences anytime
- 🚫 **CCPA Opt-Out** - "Do Not Sell" toggle for California residents

**Beautiful UI:**
- Dark theme with brand colors
- Clear card-based layout
- Warning messages for destructive actions
- Direct links to privacy policy

### 5. **API Routes**

#### `/api/privacy/export` (GET)
- Exports ALL user data in JSON format
- Includes: profile, tracking data, challenges, notifications, consent history
- Machine-readable for data portability
- Logs export request for audit trail

#### `/api/privacy/delete` (POST)
- Permanently deletes account and all data
- Requires email confirmation for security
- Uses admin Supabase client (bypass RLS)
- Logs deletion request before executing
- Deletes in correct order (respects foreign keys)

#### `/api/ccpa/do-not-sell` (POST/GET)
- CCPA-specific opt-out endpoint
- Disables analytics when opted out
- Stores preference for 12+ months
- California residents only (but available to all)

### 6. **Privacy Policy Page** (`app/privacy/page.tsx`)

**GDPR-Compliant Disclosures:**
- Data controller information
- Complete list of data collected (including health data classification)
- Legal basis for each processing activity
- Third-party services (Supabase, Amplitude, Vercel)
- Detailed cookie policy
- All user rights (GDPR & CCPA)
- Data retention periods
- International data transfers
- Contact information

**Design:**
- Modern, readable layout
- Dark theme with purple accents
- Links to privacy settings throughout
- Clear section structure

### 7. **Layout Update** (`app/layout.tsx`)

- Removed auto-loading Amplitude component
- Added CookieConsentBanner component
- Banner appears at bottom of every page

## 🔐 How GDPR Compliance is Achieved

### Valid Consent Requirements

| **Informed** | Clear descriptions of what each cookie does |
| **Unambiguous** | Explicit click required (not inferred from scrolling) |
| **Revocable** | Privacy Settings page allows changes anytime |

- Can be withdrawn at any time

### User Rights

| Right | Implementation | Location |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Access** | Download all data in JSON | Privacy Settings |

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Principle:** Privacy controls should be **beautiful and accessible**, not hidden or confusing.

## 📝 Database Migration

**Run this migration:**

```bash
# Copy migration to Supabase SQL Editor
# File: supabase/migrations/016_add_consent_management.sql

# Manually execute in Supabase Dashboard
```

**Or use Supabase CLI:**

```bash
supabase db push
```

**Creates:**
- `user_consent` table with indexes
- `privacy_settings` table with RLS policies
- Timestamp update triggers

---

## 🔍 Console Debugging

**Check consent status:**

```javascript
// In browser console
document.cookie.split(';').find(c => c.includes('fc_consent'))
// Should show: "fc_consent={\"essential\":true,\"analytics\":true,\"marketing\":false}"
```

**Check Amplitude initialization:**

```javascript
// Should see these logs:
// ✅ "🚀 Initializing Amplitude with user consent..."
// ✅ "✅ Amplitude initialized successfully"

// Or if no consent:
// ❌ "⏳ Amplitude waiting for user consent..."
```

**Test tracking block:**

```javascript
// In console, try to track event without consent
amplitude.track('test_event')
// Should see: "⚠️ Amplitude.track() blocked - analytics consent required"
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Compliance

### Audit Trail
All consent decisions stored in `user_consent` table:
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  consent_type,
  consent_given,
  consent_timestamp,
  gpc_signal
FROM user_consent
ORDER BY consent_timestamp DESC;
```

### Consent Renewal
After 12 months, you should re-request consent:
```sql
-- Find users with expired consent
SELECT * FROM user_consent
WHERE expires_at < NOW()
  AND withdrawn_at IS NULL;
```

### Analytics
Track consent acceptance rates:
```sql
-- Acceptance rate by consent type
SELECT
  consent_type,
  SUM(CASE WHEN consent_given THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) as acceptance_rate
FROM user_consent
WHERE consent_method = 'banner'
GROUP BY consent_type;
```
